# Widget Integration

## IFRAME Integration

This variant uses embedded `<div>` with `<iframe>`. The integration example is in [this repository](https://github.com/e-sdf/B2NOTE-Integration-Example) with a commented HTML page and CSS file.

As this integration is the easiest at the side of an integrating service, it is currently the preferred one, although integrating the JavaScript app is also possible (contact us if interested).
